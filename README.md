# Welcome to my Personal Repository!
(Edited on April 4, 2025)
Hello! This is to test out GitHub and see how we can use it's features for documentation purposes and more. The second file in this repository (MaristBaseRobot2024_Quad.java) is an analysis of the Marist base robot, which as of April 4, 2025, is not completed. Please use this file to educate yourself on java and FTC code. There will be more added later on.
